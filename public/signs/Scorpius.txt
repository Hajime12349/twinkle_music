Scorpius is a constellation with a large S-shape, like the tail of a scorpion, crossing the Milky Way. The ancient Mesopotamian civilization likened the S-shaped line of stars to a scorpion. In Greek mythology, the scorpion that stabbed the hero Aurion to death with a poisonous needle is believed to have become a constellation. There are many bright stars in the constellation, and Antares, the star at the heart of the scorpion, is one of the 21 first-magnitude stars in the entire sky and a famous variable star. A variable star is a star whose brightness changes with time and can be divided into several types. Opinions differ on the type of Antares, with some classifying it as a semi-regular variable star with regular or irregular variable brightness, and others classifying it as a pulsating variable star with mild changes in brightness.
