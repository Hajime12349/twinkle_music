Orion is based on the character Aurion the Hunter in Greek mythology, and according to mythology, Orion is the constellation that was created after Aurion's death and ascension to the heavens. Orion has many bright stars, including two of the 21 first-magnitude stars in the entire sky, Betelgeuse, a reddish star corresponding to Orion's shoulders, and Rigel, a pale star corresponding to his legs, and seven stars of second magnitude or higher. Variable stars are stars that change in brightness with time and can be divided into several types. Petergius is the most famous variable star in Orion, and is classified as a semi-regular variable star, which sometimes changes its brightness periodically while other times it changes its brightness irregularly.
