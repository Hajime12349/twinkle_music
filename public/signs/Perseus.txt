Perseus is a constellation that represents Perseus, the hero of Greek mythology. It is also known for the Perseid meteor shower, which can be seen every year around the middle of August. The main stars in Perseids are Alpha Milfac and Beta Algol. Algol, the second brightest star in the constellation, is a variable star located in the eye of Medusa, whose name means "devil's head. A variable star is a star whose brightness changes with time, and is classified into several types. Algol is classified as an eclipsing variable star, in which two or more binary stars hide each other and change their apparent brightness with time. Algol periodically changes its brightness from 2.1 to 3.4 magnitude, and is well known as a representative of Algol-type variable stars.
