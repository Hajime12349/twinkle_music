Whale is an ancient constellation that was known as far back as the ancient Babylonian period. The whale, which is the motif of the constellation Cetus, is a sperm whale sent by the god of the sea to devour and kill Princess Andromeda of Ethiopia, and is said to have two tusks and large, well-developed forelegs. The constellation of the whale is composed of the star Alpha Menkar, which represents the tip of the nose, Deneb Kaitos, which means "whale's tail," and the star Mira, which is located at the heart of the whale. Mira means "mysterious one" and is the most famous variable star in the constellation Cetus. A variable star is a star whose brightness changes with time, and is classified into several types. Mira is classified as a pulsating variable star, and its brightness changes from a maximum of 2.0 to 10.1 magnitude in a period of about 332 days.
